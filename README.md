# Pokeguess

Personal project that takes the `Who's that Pokemon` game from the show to the browser.

### Todo:

- [x] Complete the `async` function and render random Pokemon to the screen

- [x] Figure out the API structure for the official artwork to ensure proper URL can be obtained.

- [x] Remove mask and implement brightness filter

- [ ] Look into the PokeAPI for additional request options. Maybe we're missing something that can make our lives easier.

- [ ] Create option to select Generations of Pokemon?

- [ ] Generate map or array of numbers to avoid duplicate Pokemon
  Once used, find number, remove from array. (Great for generation selections)

- [ ] Look into animations a bit further, smooth out the process.

- [ ] Figure out design and implement design for final page



### Version 2:

- [ ] Implement point system when guessing Pokemon correctly

- [ ] Generate buttons that host current Pokemon name and others for a proper guessing game.
