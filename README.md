# Pokeguess

Personal project that takes the `Who's that Pokémon` game from the show to the browser.



### Notes

Small personal capstone project to learn and utilize asynchronous functions, fetch, and APIs.

[PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) was utilized for this project for all API calls.

*Could only utilize `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` (no libraries or frameworks).*
