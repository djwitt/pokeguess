# Pokeguess

Personal project that takes the `Who's that Pokemon` game from the show to the browser.

### Notes
Small personal capstone project to learn and utilize asynchronus functions, fetch, and APIs.

[PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) was utilized for this project for all API calls.

Could only utilize `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` (no libraries or frameworks).
